# IoT OilTankDevice

## About the Project

This project aims to develop an IoT monitoring system for domestic heating oil tanks. It provides real-time level tracking via a mobile or desktop interface, ensuring users never run out of fuel unexpectedly.

## Key Features

- **Remote Dashboard:** View real-time tank levels on any mobile device or computer.
- **Smart Alerts:** Fully configurable notifications (e.g., critical low level).
- **System Health:** Integrated **temperature and humidity sensors** inside the enclosure to ensure the device operates in a suitable environment.

## Power Management

The system is designed for **stand-alone operation** with a focus on energy efficiency:
- **Low-Power Optimization:** Software and hardware tuning to maximize battery life.
- **Solar Harvesting:** The battery is recharged via a solar panel, allowing for **extended autonomy without human intervention**.
